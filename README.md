Hi there! I'm Atharva Nitin Arbooj 👋

AI Systems Architect | Distributed Systems Engineer | ex-Uber Data Engineer

I am a "systems-first" engineer who thrives at the intersection of high-throughput backend infrastructure, predictive modeling, and autonomous agentic workflows. Currently, I am a Master’s student in Information Systems at DePaul University (GPA 3.9/4.0), focused on building the robust data backbones required for production-grade AI and scalable distributed software.

🚀 Performance & Intelligence (Professional Highlights)

Distributed Systems (Uber): Managed and optimized high-velocity streaming pipelines handling 19M+ daily records using Spark, Kafka, and Flink, ensuring sub-second latency for global marketplace telemetry.

Software Optimization (ECS): Achieved a 45% reduction in runtime for core backend SQL environments through advanced execution plan profiling and algorithmic refactoring.

Intelligence Architect (AI/ML): Engineered an AI-powered recommendation backbone and a BERT-powered NLP model (89% accuracy), bridging the gap between raw data and actionable situational awareness.

Systems Automation (The Builder): Independently architected a parallelized Python automation framework that tested 500+ concurrent jobs, increasing developer deployment productivity by 30%.
